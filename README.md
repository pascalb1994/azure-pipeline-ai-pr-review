# Use OpenAI GPT model to review Pull Requests for Azure Devops
A task for Azure DevOps build pipelines to add GPT as PR reviewer.
This is based on https://github.com/mlarhrouch/azure-pipeline-gpt-pr-review but with options for allowing users to view and edit the AI instruction prompt for more transparency and customisation.

## Installation

Installation can be done using [Visual Studio MarketPlace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=97Saundersj.AIPullRequestReview).

## Usage

Add the tasks to your build definition.

When the task is ran comments will be left on each changed file in a Pull Request.
